General reflection - what went well, what didn't go well, what have we learned, what might we do differently, etc

  Archery has come a long way since the begining  of the semester. As of this report, we have most of the game sysytems in place, with only maps, navigation and skills left to implement. There were some issues with the multiplayer portion of the game, so we had to drop that finctionality and stay single player.
  The value to the customer hasn't changed significantly. We will still retain the core functionality of the game. However, Jonathan realized that adding in multiplayer functionality would take considerably more time than we could have devoted to it. As of now, we have also discarded text input and replaced it with a more traditional JRPG interface replicated within the text capabilities of the terminal.
  So far, the only tech we have used is the Hydra machines and GitHub. Our goal is to at least have a functional RPG system coded which will lend itself to the easy creation of a game. There are several bugs within the program which we have not squashed yet. The small battle that we have running now will occasionaly crash giving us a segmentation fault. This will need to be fixed eventually, but it is not the most important right now. We also need to come up with a better system for damage calculation.
  
  For what we are doing, I beleive we are on schedule. We had initially planned to have a working skeleton by teh end of two weeks, but this plan fell through as we realized how daunting this task would be. We now hope to have the starting area coded up and playable by the end of the semester.
  We have discovered that making a game is a lot harder than many of us had at first thought. This experience has given us a new respect for those who have made this their career. If we could have started fom the begining of the semester again, I doubt we would do anything differently.
